![screenshot](https://github.com/cpolishak/projects/blob/master/CSS-Bootstrap/project2/images/css2.png)

I created this page from the ground up using bootstrap, html, css. 
## 
This page was created to show some features of bootstrap. The login/register stuff is not set up because the site is not live.

## Deployment

To be deployed on a locally hosted environment or live server.
##
To do so - Clone all files to local environment. Then open any of the html pages to see them.

## Built With

* Bootstrap / HTML / CSS 

## Authors
