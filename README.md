# Projects 

These are projects that I have created. Each folder pertains to the language, framework, library, database, etc. with which it was labeled. 
##
I will be creating some README's for each of the projects as well as I continue to hone my skills. 

## Deployment

Most projects are just to showcase things I have done. However a number of those things have been taken and deployed in my portfolio site [cpolishak.github.io](https://cpolishak.github.io/) or I can provide README's for those to show how one can launch the code to see the results as well.
